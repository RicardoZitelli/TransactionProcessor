## Requirements

- .NET 8.0+
- Docker 

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RicardoZitelli/TransactionProcessor.git
   cd transaction-processor
   ```
## Usage
1. The program will search for the transactions.csv file in folder .\src\TransactionProcessor.App\. You can replace the file with new datas.
   
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
    dotnet build
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
    dotnet run --project TransactionProcessor.App
   ```
   
4. Generated reports will be located in the Reports folder in TransactionProcessor.App.

## Docker
This project includes SQL Server Docker support. Follow these steps to set it up:
1. Build and start the containers using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. The database will run inside the container and will be accessible as configured in the docker-compose.yml file.
